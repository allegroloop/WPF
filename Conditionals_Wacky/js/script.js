//What beverage should I drink?

//Depending on what time of the day it is and when the last time I have eaten, decide whether to drink coffee, tea, or water.

//if it's between 0800 and 1200 and you have eaten in the last hour, then drink coffee.
//if it's between 1200 and 1900 and you have eaten in the last hour, than drink tea.
//all else drink water.
